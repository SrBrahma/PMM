# PMM
Fork from my own project.

**Now with a basic Wiki!**

Open Source code of the PMM (Plataforma Multimiss√£o, Multi-Mission Platform), a project of a system capable of functioning in a vast amount of diferent scenarios and applications, as rockets, drones, rovers, cars, submarines and handhelds.

Needs PlatformIO.

Formal license will be added later (I don't think so!), but it is open source to anyone or any team. Just be honest and give the proper credits. Also, contact me to tell me you used it! Will be happy to know :)
