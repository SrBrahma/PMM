# PMM
Fork from my own project -- It previously showed to be a fork of my previous team repo, but as they removed the repository, now it shows, for some reason (maybe was the oldest fork), to be a fork of another team ex-member.

**Now with a basic Wiki!** Read it to get started.

Open Source code of the PMM (Plataforma Multimiss√£o, Multi-Mission Platform), a project of a system capable of functioning in a vast amount of diferent scenarios and applications, as rockets, drones, rovers, cars, submarines and handhelds. One of my greatest projects so far.

Needs PlatformIO.

Formal license will be added later (I don't think so!), but it is open source to anyone or any team. Just be honest and give the proper credits. Also, contact me to tell me you used it! Will be happy to know :)
