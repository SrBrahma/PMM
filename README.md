# PMM

Open Source code of the PMM (Plataforma MultimissÃ£o, Multi-Mission Platform), a project of a system capable of functioning in a vast amount of diferent scenarios and applications, as rockets, drones, rovers, cars, submarines and handhelds.

Still in heavy development. Its manual will be available after the first stable release.

Needs PlatformIO. For adding it to your project, drop this repository in the root of your project and add the following lines to your platformio.ini:


>[platformio]
>
>lib_extra_dirs = pmm/lib


Formal license will be added later, but it is and will **always** be open source to anyone and any other rocketry team to use, just be honest and give the proper credits.
