# PMM
Fork from my own project.

Open Source code of the PMM (Plataforma Multimiss√£o, Multi-Mission Platform), a project of a system capable of functioning in a vast amount of diferent scenarios and applications, as rockets, drones, rovers, cars, submarines and handhelds.

Still in heavy development.

Needs PlatformIO.

Formal license will be added later, but it is and will **always** be open source to anyone and any other rocketry team to use, just be honest and give the proper credits.
